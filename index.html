    <h3>About me,</h3>
    <h4>Hello world! Welcome to my site. <br>
      My name is Anubhab Mondal. I am 28 years, born in the year 1994 in Karimpur, Nadia, <br>
      A district of West Bengal, India. I brought up there till my 10th class completion. <br>
      Since then I roaming around small and big cities of India here and there just to survive <br>
      in this dynamic world.

    <h3>More about me,</h3>
    <h4>That reminded me, I am very much interested in computer programming. But with the <br>
      absence of computer in my childhood and school days, I didn’t even know what a RAM is. <br>
      Though I still can not say how it made in factories, HAHA. But I now at least I know <br>
      its boost our computer performance and ego both significantly.

    <h3>Early academics:</h3>
    <h4>
      Okey, so enough of chit chat, let me now talk about my academics. In early academics <br>
      I completed my 10th class from Karimpur Jagannath High School with 60% marks which I guess <br>
      made my parents proud a little bit. Well, they love me enough to feel proud of me <br>
      even if I failed, they love me. Oh did I mention that I once hold a very good rank <br>
      in JEXPO Polytechnic but still didn’t sit for engineering. Still don’t know why.

    <h3>Science in 11th & 12th:</h3>
    <h4>Well curiosity in science fiction movies, what’s beyond the space, what’s deepest <br>
      in the sea and questions of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Biology pushed me to <br>
      take Science in my 11th and 12th standards. But some of the things dramatically changed <br>
      when one of my friend told me that he took computer science and struggling with C++.

    <h3>College with BCA:</h3>
    <h4>I did R&D a lot about what I should do after 12th. B.TECH or something else. <br>
      Then I ended up taking BCA. Why? Its simply because at that moment there was lot of <br>
      people doing b.tech and still ending up being jobless. So, I searched for future <br>
      technologies that I could work on and get more chances of getting a job in future. <br>
      So finally, I found B.C.A. which not only introduced me to computer from a different <br>
      perspective but also changed my thinking and vision about life. But my journey in college <br>
      didn’t start like a normal kid but like a curious kid who ask everything without shame. <br>
      I ended up asking “sir, what is this void” and sir was like, <br>
      looking at me thinking who is this person with no basic idea about <br>
      basic programming syntax.</h4>
